# TakesMyEggs

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.

## Development

This is a project of our school, the wild code school, in which we had to establish a website in 24 hours (hackaton), in order to use a predefined API and let our creativity run free. In our case, we have chosen to approach a "virtual" world, i.e. a platform for purchasing equipment/resources for video games. (RPG more specifically) This project was carried out by Quentin Moreau and Durand Thibault
